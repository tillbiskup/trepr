Who is the target audience of the trepr package? Is it interesting for me?


TREPR spectroscopists aiming at reproducibility
===============================================

The trepr package addresses every scientist working with EPR data (both, measured and calculated) on a daily base. It strives towards automating processing of TREPR data as much as possible, relieving the spectroscopist from tedious, monotonous and often enough error-prone manual routine tasks.


Motivation and general ideas
============================

The motivation an general idea behind the trepr package is to ensure reproducibility and---as much as possible---replicability for TREPR data processing, starting from recording data and ending with their final (graphical) representation, e.g., in a peer-reviewed publication. This is achieved by relying on the `ASpecD framework <https://www.aspecd.de/>`_ taking care of mostly automatically creating a gap-less record of each processing step.
