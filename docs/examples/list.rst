Example recipes
===============

Each example covers a specific aspect of working with tr-EPR spectra, is presented on its separate page, and comes with a complete, working recipe. For a bit of background on how to process and analyse tr-EPR data, see the :doc:`tr-EPR primer <../trepr/index>`.


Basic processing
================

There is a number of steps that need to be carried out on any recorded dataset to be able to properly analyse the data. Depending on the setup used, these steps may differ slightly.

Checking instrumental parameters
================================

Depending on the setup and measurement control program used, you may have access to a series of additional parameters that can be quite helpful with determining whether everything went well with your measurement. Such parameters are the microwave frequency per individual recorded time trace as well as a time stamp for each time trace.
