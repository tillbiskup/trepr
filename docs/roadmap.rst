=======
Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:

* Check sequence of axes in importers for consistency with the ASpecD conventions

* Implement BES3T importer/copy from cwepr package

* Implement all missing processing and analysis tools currently available in the trepr toolbox developed for MATLAB\ |reg|

* Start to (re)implement functionality test-driven.

* Batch processing

  * Basic preprocessing, plot, export as PNG/PDF, figure caption for dokuwiki


Todos
=====

A list of todos, extracted from the code and documentation itself, and only meant as convenience for the main developers. Ideally, this list will be empty at some point.
