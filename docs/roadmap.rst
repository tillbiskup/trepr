Roadmap
=======

A few ideas how to develop the project further, currently a list as a reminder for the main developers themselves, in no particular order, though with a tendency to list more important aspects first:


For version 0.1
===============

* Check TREPR-specific processing steps for correct sequence of axes

* Move tex template to own directory and rename it

* Implement Bruker BES3T importer/copy from cwepr package

* Sphinx multiversion


For later versions
==================

* Implement fsc2 importer (?)

* Start to (re)implement functionality test-driven.

* Batch processing

  * Basic preprocessing, plot, export as PNG/PDF, figure caption for dokuwiki


Todos
=====

A list of todos, extracted from the code and documentation itself, and only meant as convenience for the main developers. Ideally, this list will be empty at some point.
