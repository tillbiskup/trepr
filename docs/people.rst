Who are the people behind the cwEPR package?

The trEPR package was initially implemented by J. Popp during her internship and masters thesis in 2018/19 at the University of Freiburg, supervised by Till Biskup, the author of the `ASpecD framework <https://www.aspecd.de/>`_ and maintainer of the trEPR package.

In autumn 2020, partly due to personal needs of the maintainer, development resumed, and Mirjam Schr√∂der joined the development team.
