trepr documentation
===================

Welcome! This is the documentation for trepr, a Python package for processing and analysis of time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (tr-EPR) spectra based on the `ASpecD framework <https://www.aspecd.de/>`_. For general information see its `Homepage <https://www.trepr.de/>`_. Due to the inheritance from the ASpecD superclass, all data generated with the trepr package are completely reproducible and have a complete history.

.. warning::
  The trepr package is currently under active development and still considered in Alpha development state. Therefore, expect frequent changes in features and public APIs that may break your own code. Nevertheless, feedback as well as feature requests are highly welcome.

A note on the logo
------------------

The snake (a python) resembles the lines of a tr-EPR spectrum, most probably a light-induced spin-polarised triplet state. The copyright of the logo belongs to J. Popp.
