Recording tr-EPR spectra
========================

* How to properly record data

  * laser settings: power, wavelength, repetition rate, and polarisation

  * amplifier gain and digitiser sensitivity

  * magnetic field range and resolution

  * length and resolution of time traces

  * number of accumulations per field point

  * direction of recording data

  * proper phasing
