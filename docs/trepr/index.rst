tr-EPR spectroscopy
===================

What follows is a rather hands-on introduction to recording, processing and analysing tr-EPR spectra. Don't expect any details about the physics behind EPR spectroscopy. For this, the reader is referred to the body of excellent EPR literature.


.. important::
    The following is in no way meant to replace reading good books about EPR spectroscopy and to get a proper in-person training from experienced spectroscopists in the lab. However, as good hands-on EPR books are rare (and particularly their existence in EPR labs), as is good in-person training, the following content may be useful for some people. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee of the information provided here to be accurate or applicable to your specific situation. Use entirely on your own risk.


There are a number of aspects covered in this tr-EPR spectroscopy primer, as can be seen from the table of contents. One key idea is that recording tr-EPR spectra, however complicated in detail this may be, can be mostly automated and formalised. The central aspect of spectroscopy is *not* recording and accumulating raw data, but processing and analysing these data.

Of course, processing and analysis are described with particular focus on the trepr package. However, there should be a lot of information there that is of more general use. After all, the trepr package is developed and maintained by people actively working in the field.
