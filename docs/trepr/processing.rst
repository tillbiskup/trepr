Data processing
===============

Data processing is a necessary prerequisite for :doc:`data analysis <analysis>`, and therefore separate from the latter. The main effort in spectroscopy is usually *not* recording the raw data, but processing and analysing those data in order to answer the questions that triggered the measurements in the first place.

Processing steps can be categorised further. The following is an attempt to
do that for cwEPR data and to summarise how to properly record and
(post-)process cwEPR data. For more authoritative answers, you may as well have a look into the EPR literature, particularly the "EPR Primer" by Chechik/Carter/Murphy and the book on quantitative EPR by the Eatons.
