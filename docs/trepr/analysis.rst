Data analysis
=============

In nearly all cases, data analysis needs to be preceded with :doc:`data processing <processing>`. While processing steps can usually be automated to a large extend and are rather generally applicable, data analysis is usually much more focussed on individual types of measurements and the actual questions at hand.

Eventually, fitting spectral simulations to the recorded data can be regarded as analysis steps as well. Usually, they are the only way to extract parameters from tr-EPR data with sufficient accuracy.

* Analyses to check for correct data recording

  * Microwave frequency drift analysis
  * Check for continuous data recording

* Analyses extracting information from the recorded data

  * Transient nutation analysis (FFT)
