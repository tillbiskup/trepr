Welcome to trepr's documentation!
=================================

trepr is a package, based on the ASpecD framework, for handling trepr data. Due to the inheritance from the ASpecD superclass, all data generated with the trepr package are completely reproducible and have a complete history.

.. warning::
  The trepr package is currently under active development and still considered in Alpha development state. Therefore, expect frequent changes in features and public APIs that may break your own code. Nevertheless, feedback as well as feature requests are highly welcome.

The easiest way to use the trepr package is to hand over a yaml-file to the trepr-caller::

    import trepr
    trepr.Caller('your_yaml_file.yaml')
