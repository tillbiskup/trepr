trepr
=====

``trepr`` is a framework for handling trepr data focussing on reproducibility. In short: Each and every processing step applied to your data will be recorded and can be traced back, and additionally, for each representation of your data (e.g., figures, tables) you can easily follow how the data shown have been processed and where they originate from.

The easiest way to use the trepr package is to hand over a yaml-file to the trepr-caller:

    import trepr
    trepr.Caller('your_yaml_file.yaml')
